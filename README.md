# 🌐 Random Data Generator Web App

A simple full-stack web application built with **Spring Boot**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** that:

- Generates random user data using [Java Faker](https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker)
- Shows a random inspirational quote
- Simulates weather data for a given city (no API key required)
- Changes UI theme dynamically based on mock weather

This project is ideal as a starter for learning Java + Tailwind UI, or demoing Spring Boot endpoints and dynamic UIs without external API dependencies.
